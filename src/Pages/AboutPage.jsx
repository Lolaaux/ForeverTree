              We identify deforested and degraded lands across Europe and
              restore them through strategic tree planting initiatives.
              <br />
              <br />
              Every tree we plant absorbs carbon, combats erosion, and helps
              reverse the effects of climate change.We work with local farmers,
              landowners, and community members to create long-term employment
              and support green livelihoods. Our efforts ensure that
              reforestation is both socially and economically sustainable.
